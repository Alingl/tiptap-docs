# Extensions
[`tiptap-extensions`](@tiptap-extensions) is a package containing many ready-made components officially maintained by the tiptap project maintainers and community. It's goal is to minimise the effort to implement your own editor features while keeping the core design principles of a *renderless* editor.

The extensions package provides ProseMirror plugins, Nodes, or Marks that can be added to tiptap. You are free to implement your own extensions as well. By using them, you barely have to think about defining your own ProseMirror [Document schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#schema), as it is dynamically composed based on all extensions you have registered with your [`Editor` instance](../api/classes.md#editor)

For a full list of officially supported extensions, check the [built-in extensions list](./built-in.md) section in the documentation.
