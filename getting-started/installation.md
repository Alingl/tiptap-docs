# Installation

Install the `tiptap` package with your favorite package manager:
```
npm add tiptap
```
or
```
yarn add tiptap
```

Although optional, you might want to install [`tiptap-extensions`](../extensions/basics.md#installation) package
so that you can use many of the ready-made components maintained by the tiptap team.


> Older versions of NPM requires you to use `npm install` instead.
